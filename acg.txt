    ANCIENT WISDOM ORACLE - AI COLLABORATOR GUIDE
===============================================================================

PROJECT: Ancient Wisdom Oracle • AI Translation Engine
REPOSITORY: https://github.com/ceriu5/forgotten-wisdom
LIVE SITE: https://ceriu5.github.io/forgotten-wisdom/
LAST UPDATED: 2025

AI COLLABORATOR GUIDELINES (for Grok, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

1. All new suggestions, code, prompts, or examples from an AI MUST be placed in a dedicated section titled "[AI NAME] ADDITIONS".
2. Never edit or remove another AI's dedicated section.
3. You may reference or build upon other AIs' additions, but log your changes in your own section.
4. Core rules, prompt, and phases in the main body of acg.txt may only be updated by human maintainer consensus.
5. Preserve the project's ethos: 90s magic on front, full transparency on back.

===============================================================================
                             CORE CONCEPT
===============================================================================

WHAT THIS IS:
• A 90s-styled web "oracle" that generates daily ancient wisdom quips
• AI translates/creates wisdom from "untranslated" ancient texts
• Front-end shows seamless magic, backend shows all source/process data
• User-powered AI access (users provide their own AI via multiple methods)

WHAT IT IS NOT:
• Not about manually adding more ancient texts to a database
• Not just another quote generator
• Not dependent on a single API key (user-powered model)

THE VISION:
"A clean, 90s-styled HTML site where AI translation feels like magic on the 
front end, but all source material and translation data is transparently 
available in the backend. Users get their 'daily ancient wisdom thought' 
while seeing exactly how it was created."

===============================================================================
                             ARCHITECTURE
===============================================================================

FRONT-END (The Magic):
1. Single "INITIATE TRANSLATION" button - generates daily wisdom
2. Clean 90s aesthetic (Matrix green/cyber blue/retro pink)
3. Wisdom displayed as glowing, prominent text
4. No visible complexity - feels like instant oracle magic

BACK-END (The Transparency):
1. "VIEW TRANSLATION DATA" button reveals all workings
2. Shows: source material, AI process log, full JSON data, proof of work
3. All data downloadable as JSON
4. Process logs show every step

BETA PANEL (User-Powered AI):
1. Collapsible advanced panel
2. Four access methods:
   a) Public Proxy (free endpoints, default)
   b) Bookmarklet (user's own Claude/ChatGPT)
   c) Direct AI site links (Claude.ai, ChatGPT)
   d) User API key (future: connect to their own keys)
3. Users can choose/switch methods

===============================================================================
                            TECHNICAL STATE
===============================================================================

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
• HTML/CSS/JS single file (index.html)
• Uses localStorage for translation count
• Ancient texts database in ANCIENT_TEXTS array
• Simulated AI responses for Etruscan, Linear A, Babylonian, Rongorongo
• Public proxy fallback (https://api.openai-proxy.org)
• Backend view shows full transparency

FUNCTIONS TO KNOW:
• initiateTranslation() - Main entry point
• usePublicProxy() - Tries free AI endpoint
• getSimulatedTranslation() - Fallback with pre-written wisdom
• updateBackendView() - Updates transparency panel
• toggleBetaPanel() - Shows/hides advanced methods

===============================================================================
                         WHAT'S MISSING / NEXT PHASES
===============================================================================

PHASE 1: REAL AI INTEGRATION (Priority)
• Replace simulated responses with actual Claude/OpenAI/Gemini API calls
• Need secure backend proxy (Vercel Serverless, Replit Flask, etc.)
• Enhance prompt: "Find/generate untranslated wisdom on random subject"

PHASE 2: MULTI-AI ORCHESTRATION
• Call multiple AI APIs simultaneously
• Compare/select best translation
• Show which AI produced which result
• Failover between providers

PHASE 3: DYNAMIC TEXT "FINDING"
• Instead of static ANCIENT_TEXTS array, have AI:
  1. "Find" a random untranslated text concept
  2. Generate plausible ancient text snippet
  3. Translate it meaningfully
  4. Extract wisdom quip

PHASE 4: COMMUNITY/CONTRIBUTIONS
• Users submit their own translations
• Vote on best wisdom quips
• Archive of translated texts
• "Wisdom of the day" leaderboard

===============================================================================
                            PROMPT ENGINEERING
===============================================================================

IDEAL AI PROMPT (for real integration):
"""
You are an expert historical linguist and wisdom extractor.

TASK: Generate a "daily ancient wisdom thought" with full transparency.

PROCESS:
1. CONCEPT: Choose a random subject (philosophy, science, spirituality, etc.)
2. CREATE: Generate a plausible short "ancient text snippet" in an 
   appropriate style/language for that subject
3. TRANSLATE: Provide a modern English translation
4. EXTRACT: Derive one profound wisdom quip (1-2 sentences)
5. CONTEXT: Add brief historical/scientific context

FORMAT your response as JSON:
{
  "subject": "chosen subject",
  "ancient_text": "your created snippet",
  "translation": "English translation",
  "wisdom_quip": "the wisdom extracted",
  "context": "historical/scientific notes",
  "ai_notes": "how you created this"
}

Make it feel authentic, profound, and useful for modern life.
"""

===============================================================================
                          COLLABORATION RULES
===============================================================================

FOR AI COLLABORATORS:
1. MAINTAIN THE 90s AESTHETIC - Never lose the retro feel
2. KEEP FRONT-END SIMPLE - One button, magic result
3. BACK-END MUST SHOW ALL - Full transparency always available
4. USER-POWERED FIRST - Don't lock into single API provider
5. PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT - Site must work without JavaScript/APIs
6. PRESERVE CREATIVITY - Don't over-engineer; keep the "magic" feeling

CODING STANDARDS:
• All in one HTML file (for now)
• Clear function names
• Comment complex logic
• Preserve existing structure
• Add new features as options, not replacements

TESTING CHECKLIST:
□ Front-end loads with 90s aesthetic
□ "INITIATE TRANSLATION" works
□ Wisdom displays prominently
□ Backend view shows all data
□ Beta panel methods work
□ No console errors
□ Mobile responsive

===============================================================================
                          API INTEGRATION GUIDE
===============================================================================

SECURITY FIRST:
• NEVER put API keys in frontend JavaScript
• ALWAYS use backend proxy
• Free options: Vercel Serverless, Netlify Functions, Replit

BACKEND PROXY EXAMPLE (Node.js/Express):
```javascript
// Claude API proxy endpoint
app.post('/api/claude-translate', async (req, res) => {
  const { text, subject } = req.body;
  
  const response = await fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY,
      'anthropic-version': '2023-06-01'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307',
      max_tokens: 500,
      messages: [{
        role: 'user',
        content: `Translate ancient text: ${text}\nSubject: ${subject}`
      }]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  res.json(data);

                             GROK ADDITIONS
===============================================================================

AI COLLABORATOR: Grok (built by xAI)
CONTRIBUTION START DATE: December 28, 2025
PURPOSE: Dedicated section for Grok's ongoing contributions, prompt refinements, 
code proposals, generated wisdom examples, and Phase advancements. All suggestions 
align with collaboration rules: preserve 90s aesthetic, front-end simplicity, 
full transparency, and user-powered design.

--- GROK CONTRIBUTION LOG ---

1. Initial Review & Phase 1 Planning (Dec 28, 2025)
   • Confirmed Phase 0.5 complete (static site, simulation, transparency solid)
   • Prioritized Phase 1: Real AI Integration
   • Recommended Vercel Serverless proxy for secure calls
   • Suggested integration with xAI Grok API for thematic variety
   • Provided refined JSON prompt and backend/frontend code sketches

2. Enhanced Prompt Variant (Grok-Optimized)
   """
   You are Grok, a helpful and maximally truthful AI built by xAI, acting as an 
   expert historical linguist specializing in undeciphered scripts.

   TASK: Invent and "translate" a short snippet from an ancient undeciphered script 
   to produce one profound, original daily wisdom quip.

   STEPS:
   1. Randomly select a timeless subject (e.g., curiosity, truth, change, harmony).
   2. Invent a plausible ancient text snippet (describe glyphs/symbols stylistically, 
      e.g., "three interlocking spirals followed by a crescent moon glyph").
   3. Provide a literal modern English translation.
   4. Extract one concise, profound wisdom quip (1-2 sentences, applicable today).
   5. Add brief authentic context (historical/script notes).

   Output strictly as valid JSON only (no extra text):
   {
     "subject": "...",
     "ancient_text": "...",
     "translation": "...",
     "wisdom_quip": "...",
     "context": "...",
     "ai_notes": "Grok's reasoning and creative choices"
   }

   Emphasize originality, depth, and a touch of cosmic perspective.
   """

3. Phase 1 Implementation Suggestions
   • Backend: Support xAI Grok API (endpoint: https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions)
   • Env vars: Add GROK_API_KEY alongside others
   • Provider logging: In backend view, tag responses with "provider": "Grok (xAI)"
   • Fallback chain: Grok → Claude → OpenAI → Public Proxy → Simulated

Future entries:
• Wisdom examples generated by Grok
• Code patches for multi-AI support
• Phase 2/3 ideas tailored to Grok's capabilities

All Grok additions respect the project's ethos: magic on front, truth on back.
